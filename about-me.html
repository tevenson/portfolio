        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Not if I weaken first. Your head is not an artifact! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. How long can two people talk about nothing? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked.</p>
        <p>I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. and attack the Romulans. I'll be sure to note that in my log. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>
        <p>What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion?</p>
